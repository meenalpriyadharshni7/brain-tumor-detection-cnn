# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect the
presence of brain tumors from MRI images. The goal is to assist early diagnosis
by automatically classifying MRI scans into tumor and non-tumor categories.

## 🧠 Methodology
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- Data augmentation to improve generalization
- CNN-based feature extraction and classification
- Binary classification: Tumor vs No Tumor

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📊 Evaluation
- Model evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Confusion matrix and training/validation curves visualized
- Achieved strong validation performance on medical imaging data

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Dataset not included due to size and usage constraints
- Notebook contains the complete training and evaluation pipeline

---

## 🔮 Future Work
- Extend to multi-class tumor classification
- Improve robustness with transfer learning
- Deploy as a web-based diagnostic tool
